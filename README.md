##Who Bet Shalom Congregation is and how they are using this application
Bet Shalom Congregation is a Reform Jewish congregation located in Minnetonka, Minnesota. Their religious school is
committed to working together with all families to create a safe and positive environment for children to learn and
grow in their Jewish faith. The Bet Shalom Religious School meets twice a week; Sunday morning and Wednesday evening.
The teachers work full-time outside of school and volunteer their time as a way to give back to the community. This
application allows admins and teachers to create lesson plans and share them with each other. This will save time
for everyone by allowing them spend more time teaching rather than building brand new lesson plans every
week.

##How this applications works
This application is deployed and getting used, but being a private site here are some screen shots to give
you a better idea of how everything works.

lesson plans that have been submitted for approval. All lesson plans created must be approved by an admin before they
are searchable by other users.
